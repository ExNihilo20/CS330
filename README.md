# 3D Scene Creation Project

## Project Overview
This project involved creating a 3D scene using C++ and OpenGL, based on a 2D image. The goal was to develop a fully interactive 3D environment with multiple objects, textures, lighting, and camera controls. The project gave me a chance to work with existing code to create a custom scene.

## Reflection

### Approaching Software Design

#### New Design Skills
- Bringing 2D concepts into 3D space
- Balancing visual appeal with performance constraints
- Designing intuitive user interactions for 3D navigation

#### Design Process
1. Analyzed the 2D reference image
2. Broke down complex shapes into basic 3D mesh objects
3. Planned object placement and scene composition
4. Designed lighting and textures to enhance visual appeal
5. Iteratively refined the scene based on feedback and testing

#### Future Application
- This design approach can be applied to larger-scale projects
- User-centric design is valuable across various software domains

### Program Development Approach

#### New Development Strategies
- Incremental development of 3D objects and features
- Utilization of OpenGL's shader programming
- Performance optimization techniques for 3D rendering
- Met project deadlines, adhered to project schedule

#### Role of Iteration
Iteration was crucial in refining object models, textures, and lighting. Each milestone provided an opportunity to improve and build upon previous work. One week's work grew new skills necessary for the next. 

#### Evolution of Code Development
I refined my approach each week from basic implementations to more sophisticated, optimized solutions. I learned to better structure my code for reusability and maintainability.

### Impact of Computer Science on Goals

#### Educational Pathway
- Enhanced understanding of linear algebra and 3D mathematics
- Improved problem-solving skills in complex visual systems
- Grew experience in graphics programming applicable to various CS fields


#### Professional Pathway
- Acquired skills relevant to game development, VR/AR, and scientific visualization
- Developed a portfolio piece demonstrating 3D graphics expertise
- Gained insight into the intersection of art and technology in software development
- Developed more customer-centric design mentality

## Conclusion
This project has significantly expanded my skills in 3D graphics programming and software design. I had little to no experience in graphics at the outset of the course, and non in OpenGL C++ libraries. CS-330 has reinforced the importance of iterative development and user-centric design, while also providing valuable experience applicable to both educational and professional pursuits in computer science.
